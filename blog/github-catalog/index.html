Since joining GitHub in 2015 it became my home for code, as it has for many people. Being a student, and therefore bleeding money, it makes no sense <em>to write anything but open source software</em>. Okay, so maybe that&#x27;s not quite true, but regardless, it is the case that I <em>have</em> written a lot of open source software whether advantageous or not, and with only a few exceptions GitHub has been where I put that software. </p><p>Part of creating a website for myself is an attempt to better document my life, if only for my own sanity, and this page is part of that. I am going to go through a selection of my 39 public GitHub repositories. I will be intentionally leaving out projects that are linked on my <a href="/work">work</a> page or projects that I have (or plan to) write individual blog posts for.</p><p>So enough preamble lets look around, going backwards through time.</p><a class="anchor-point" id="rust-tracer(2018)"></a><a class="anchor" href="#rust-tracer(2018)"><h1>rust-tracer (2018)</h1><br/></a><p>This was a my second attempt at a ray tracer. I followed along with <a href="http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html">Peter Shirley&#x27;s books</a> on the subject which really make ray tracing quite accessible. I also wanted to learn Rust and so I adopted his C++ code to the new language. Compared to a simpler ray tracer I had written a year prior, in C++ for a University course, this produced significantly better looking renders in much less time.</p><p><img alt="ray trace" src="/static/blog/github-catalog/rust-tracer.png"/></p><p>There are still plenty of features left to be implemented.

The results aren&#x27;t amazing, but it was the first time I had ever any written real amount of shader code. </p><p>All of the actual procedural generation is performed in the shader using a simplex noise algorithm and the planets themselves are generated on a cube which is then mapped to spherical coordinates. </p><p><img alt="procedural planet" src="/static/blog/github-catalog/vorld.png"/></p><p><em><a href="https://github.com/ejrbuss/vorld">GitHub link</a></em> </p><a class="anchor-point" id="schema-reflector(2017)"></a><a class="anchor" href="#schema-reflector(2017)"><h1>schema-reflector (2017)</h1><br/></a><p>This was another University course project, this time a group effort.

In particular we were focused on analyzing the <a href="https://oscar-emr.com/">OSCAR EMR database</a>. Additionally, we did some static analysis work and could extract semantic data from annotated ORM Java files. It was a little bit finicky, but again we were focused on extracting the data from the OSCAR EMR source, and worried less about how it handled other projects.

I wanted a Java REPL so immensely I tried to write one. Now that <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-repl">Java 9</a> is a thing Java has a real REPL, which is pretty cool. My approach was a lot less sophisticated.</p><p>The basic idea is to manage a source file behind the scenes. Every time you type a new line of Java code that line is added to an approbate spot in a Java file <em>template</em> and then that file is written, compiled, and run. Obviously an inefficient technique, but it worked surprisingly well. I recall being able to use it for a couple second year Computer Science courses, and since it produced an actual Java file, your work was effectively <em>saved</em> in a convenient manner. By providing a <code>.java</code> file on the command line JI would compile that file too and keep it in the same directory, making it easy to interact with the file. Using some abusive regexes, and sneaky <code>System.out.println</code>s features like multiline code segments and the P in REPL were possible.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the Java file template in all its glory</p><div class="editor"><div class="code" data-lang="python"><div class="gutter"><span class="line-number">1</span><span class="line-number">2</span><span class="line-number">3</span><span class="line-number">4</span><span class="line-number">5</span><span class="line-number">6</span><span class="line-number">7</span><span class="line-number">8</span><span class="line-number">9</span><span class="line-number">10</span><span class="line-number">11</span></div><div class="text"><pre><span class="hljs-comment"># The template format for JI.java</span>

Python was the first language I learned after Java, and it was a beautiful discovery. The pitch here is Java Swing, for the command line, written in Python.
